									<p>Should I one day decide to move from my recently purchased home, my first call will be to Grant Smith. I can not possibly have higher praise for Grant and I strongly recommend him as a realtor.</p><p>Grant succeeded in finding for me the place I had been dreaming of despite the high demand and limited supply of housing in Dane County. His knowledge and expertise was most helpful, but it was his approach and personal touch which I appreciated, particularly in those moments when I required assurance all hope was not lost. In this trying local housing market, Grant is perfectly suited for first-time buyers like me.  He patiently walked me through each step of the process, heeded my specifications and did not waste my time showing properties unsuitable to my needs. </p><p>Again, I strongly recommend Grant Smith and I encourage any buyer or seller to contract his services.</p>

									<p class="">Grant did a superb job of taking us through the process. He has integrity and professionalism.  At a couple of points he could have pushed for a self serving short cut that would have preserved the chance for a quick sale and commission, but Grant took the high road, always keeping my interests above his own.  That is hard to find  these days.</p>

									<p class="">He was always extremely flexible with the timing of our showings. We always felt very comfortable telling him exactly what we thought. If we didn't like it, he scrapped it immediately. He helped us along the way with each step in regards to paperwork and payments, always checking in to make sure we   were comfortable. If and when we sell/move again, we will without a doubt use him again. Amazingly professional through the entire process.</p>

									<p class="">As first time home buyers, having a realtor that was both patient and knowledgeable was very important to us.  Grant led us through the entire process and was always willing to answer our (many) questions! He got right to work and started scheduling showings as soon as we were ready.  He helped to ensure the closing process went smoothly and that we were following all the appropriate steps. There were a couple of issues that came up during the home inspection and Grant negotiated with the sellers to make sure some items were corrected before the closing.  Grant is very friendly and easy to get along with too!  He made searching for homes fun. We love our first home but if we ever do decide to move we will definitely give Grant a call to help us again.</p>
