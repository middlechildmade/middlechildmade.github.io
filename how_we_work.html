                                <h1>Homeowners</h1>
								<p>When you hire Free Agent Realty to list your home, you gain access to a dedicated professional to <span class="inline_highlight">sell the property free of commission by agreeing to allow us to represent you in the purchase of your next house.</span> Often times that arrangement results in savings of 3% of the sales price. The additional equity stays with you. By utilizing Free Agent Realty as your buyer’s agent our commission is typically paid for by the seller of the home you purchase.</p>
