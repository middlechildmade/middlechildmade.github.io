short_description: Bought a Single Family home in 2016 for approximately $200K in Cottage Grove, WI.
full_description: Should I one day decide to move from my recently purchased home, my first call will be to Grant Smith. I can not possibly have higher praise for Grant and I strongly recommend him as a realtor.<br /><br />Grant succeeded in finding for me the place I had been dreaming of despite the high demand and limited supply of housing in Dane County. His knowledge and expertise was most helpful, but it was his approach and personal touch which I appreciated, particularly in those moments when I required assurance all hope was not lost. In this trying local housing market, Grant is perfectly suited for first-time buyers like me.  He patiently walked me through each step of the process, heeded my specifications and did not waste my time showing properties unsuitable to my needs. <br /><br />Again, I strongly recommend Grant Smith and I encourage any buyer or seller to contract his services.
