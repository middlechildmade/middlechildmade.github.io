short_description: Bought a Single Family home in 2016 for approximately $175K in Eken Park, Madison, WI.
full_description: As first time home buyers, having a realtor that was both patient and knowledgeable was very important to us.  Grant led us through the entire process and was always willing to answer our (many) questions! He got right to work and started scheduling showings as soon as we were ready.  He helped to ensure the closing process went smoothly and that we were following all the appropriate steps. There were a couple of issues that came up during the home inspection and Grant negotiated with the sellers to make sure some items were corrected before the closing.  Grant is very friendly and easy to get along with too!  He made searching for homes fun. We love our first home but if we ever do decide to move we will definitely give Grant a call to help us again.
